/*I created a html selector and gave it a font-size property set to 62.5%. This will set the default font size for the web page to 10px (the browser default is 16px).

This will make it easier for you to work with rem units later, as 2rem would be 20px.

I've also, set the box-sizing property to border-box.*/
